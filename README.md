# KhInsider Downloder

![Main Build](https://github.com/jacobheater/khinsider-downloader/actions/workflows/ci-main.yml/badge.svg)

This is a small, but **lightning fast**, utility command line application
that aids with downloading soundtracks from
[khinsider](https://downloads.khinsider.com/).
The purpose of this application is to expedite the
download process by downloading the album in the desired
format.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the app running.

### Installing the App

- Download NodeJS
- Run `npm install` in the project directory.

### Running the App

There are two ways to run the app â€“ with `ts-node` directly
invoking the `index.ts` file, or you can use the `npm start`
command, and pass the expected arguments there.

#### Available Arguments

```bash
Options:
      --help       Show help                                           [boolean]
      --version    Show version number                                 [boolean]
  -a, --album      The album to download.                    [string] [required]
  -o, --outdir     The name of the folder to produce.        [string] [required]
  -f, --format     Which format do you want to download?
                              [string] [choices: "flac", "mp3"] [default: "mp3"]
  -l, --log-level  What level of logging verbosity do you want?
                   [string] [choices: "info", "warn", "error"] [default: "info"]
```

#### Using `npm start`

```bash
npm start -- --album="{album here}" --outdir="~/Downloads"
```

#### Using `ts-node`

```bash
npx ts-node ./src/app.ts --album="{album here}" --outdir="~/Downloads" --format="mp3|flac" --log-level="info|warn|error"
```

#### Album Argument Explained

The `--album` argument should be the name of the album
that is the last part of the `khinsider` URL. An example
follows below.

Given the following URL:
`https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/legend-of-zelda-the-ocarina-of-time-1998-n64` you will want
to take the `legend-of-zelda-the-ocarina-of-time-1998-n64`
portion of the URL. This is what must be supplied to the
`--album` argument.

## How the Output is Generated

Given the album name, the `--outdir` argument will
be where the download is output. For example, given
`legend-of-zelda-the-ocarina-of-time-1998-n64` as the
album name, then a folder will be created in the
supplied directory with the given album name. All
songs that are downloaded will be written to that named
folder.

## Development

### Available Scripts

The project includes several utility scripts to help with development:

- `npm run clean` - Removes bin, coverage, dist, and temp directories
- `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript files
- `npm run rebuild` - Runs clean and build in sequence
- `npm run sync-version` - Synchronizes version between package.json and app-config.json
- `npm test` - Runs Jest tests
- `npm run test:coverage` - Runs tests with coverage reporting

### Version Management

The project uses `sync-version` script to keep version information consistent between package.json and the application configuration file. This script runs automatically after version changes through the `postversion` hook.

## Running from Source

To run the application from source code, you'll need to clone this repository
and have Node.js installed on your system. After cloning, run `npm install`
to install dependencies, then use one of the run commands described above.

## Distribution

This application is distributed as source code and can be run with Node.js.
The application requires Node.js to be installed on the target system.

### Entry Point

The main entry point is `src/app.ts`. When using `ts-node` directly, you should use:

```bash
npx ts-node ./src/app.ts --album="{album here}" --outdir="~/Downloads"
```

### Event System

The application implements an event system that emits events when songs are written to disk. This could be useful for developers looking to extend the application's functionality.

### Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling for common scenarios:
- `AlbumNotFoundError` - Thrown when the specified album cannot be found
- `ArgumentInvalidError` - Thrown when command arguments are missing or invalid
